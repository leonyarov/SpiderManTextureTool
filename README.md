## First Section - 'Original file'
Drag-n-drop or use 'Select' to provide path to the **.texture** file.
**Batch Mode** sets the tool to use folders instead of specific files.

The conversion is done with RawTex. The tool can detect the size of the texture automatically (which is the recommended parameter),
